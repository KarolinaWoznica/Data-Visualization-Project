## Overview

This repository presents an analysis of the suicide rate in 10 European countries between 2000 and 2010. It will be analyzed whether the suicide rate depends on age, gender, generation, and GDP per capita. The number of suicides in Poland will also be examined in comparison with other countries. The period studied is 2000 to 2010, as data from later years are incomplete. The selection of the 10 countries was made by choosing countries whose GDP is closest to that of Poland. The selected countries are Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Finland, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Spain.
